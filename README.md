# Generating Controllable Story Plots with Reinforcement Learning
This dissertation project aims to replicate the ideas and methods of Martin et al.â€™s 2019 paper Controllable Neural Story Plot Generation via Reward-Shaping: training a neural network
to generate story plots from a corpus of plot summaries and using reward-shaping to focus the outputs. I will compare results from different models trained on different datasets.

Dataset needed: CMU Movie Summary Corpus (https://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/personas/).

Model needed: Stanford CoreNLP jar (https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html)
